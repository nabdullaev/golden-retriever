## **Project Description**

**Golden Retriever** is an intelligent recommendation platform designed to help users find the perfect restaurant, coffee shop, bar, or pub based on their personal preferences, past visits, and real-time data from various sources. By leveraging machine learning, the platform analyzes user behavior and restaurant data, such as reviews, costs, location, ambiance, photos, and food offerings, to provide personalized suggestions. Additionally, Golden Retriever allows users to compare restaurants side-by-side, enabling more informed decisions when choosing a place to dine or socialize.

## **Idea**

Golden Retriever aims to create a personalized dining recommendation engine that goes beyond basic filters like location and cuisine. By analyzing a user's previous visits, preferences, and external data, the platform recommends venues that best match their taste. The comparison feature provides side-by-side insights into multiple options, helping users choose the best venue for their needs.

## **Problem Solved**

Finding the right restaurant or venue can be overwhelming due to the sheer number of options and the need to consult multiple apps or websites for reviews, menus, and prices. Current recommendation systems often lack personalization and fail to give a complete view of the dining experience. Golden Retriever solves this by providing personalized recommendations based on user history and preferences, while also offering comprehensive data on each venue to make decision-making easier.
